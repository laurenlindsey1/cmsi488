# Homework #3

### 1. Classify the following as a syntax error, semantic error, or not a compile time error. In the case where code is given, assume all identifiers are properly declared and in scope. All items refer to the Java language.

#### a. x+++-y
Syntax error 

#### b. x---+y
Syntax error

#### c. incrementing a read-only variable
Semantic error

#### d. accessing a private field in another class
Semantic error

#### e. Using an uninitialized variable
Semantic error

#### f. Dereferencing a null reference
not a compile time error

#### g. null instanceof C
not a compile time error 

#### h. !!x
Syntax error

### 2. State scope rules that would have caused them:

#### a. 3,  5
outer variables accessible in inner scope, until a diff variable is declared in the same scope


#### b. undefined NaN

#### c. Error on line 3: x is not declared

#### d. 75354253672

#### d. 75354253674

#### e. 3

#### e. -23482937128

#### f. Error on line 4: x used in its own declaration


### 3.  Describe the semantics of private in Ruby and C#. (Hint: theyâ€™re quite different.)
